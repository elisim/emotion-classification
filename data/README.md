# EmotionLines Description

EmotionLines contains a total of 29245 labeled utterances from 
2000 dialogues. Each utterance in dialogues is labeled with one of 
seven emotions, six Ekmanâ€™s basic emotions plus the neutral emotion. Each labeling was 
accomplished by 5 workers, and for each utterance in a label, the emotion category with 
the highest votes was set as the label of the utterance. 
Those utterances voted as more than two different emotions were put into the non-neutral category. 
Therefore the dataset has a total of 8 types of emotion labels:

* anger
* disgust
* fear
* happiness
* sadness
* surprise 
* neutral
* non-neutral

## Technical Details
**Download link:** http://doraemon.iis.sinica.edu.tw/emotionlines/download.html

It contains two datasets, Friends and EmotionPush. The Friends dataset is open to download,
while the EmotionPush dataset is not (need to ask for access). 

### Problem Definition
Given the transcript of a conversation along with speaker
information of each  utterance, the ERC task aims
to identify the emotion of each utterance from a set of predefined emotions. 
Fig. 2 illustrates one such conversation between two people, where each utterance is labeled by
the underlying emotion. Formally, given the input sequence
of `N` number of utterances `[(u1, p1), (u2, p2), . . . ,(uN , pN )]`,
where each utterance `ui = [ui,1, ui,2, . . . , ui,T ]` consists of `T`
words `ui,j` and spoken by party `pi`, the task is to predict the
emotion label `ei` of each utterance `ui`

This paper contains "datasets" section, which contains another datasets for emotion recognition 
in dialogues.


# My Plan
* Reproduce the methods from emotionlines paper
* Think about transformers

Questions: what to check now in the EDA? 
In this type of problem, how can we use transformers to find the order?
